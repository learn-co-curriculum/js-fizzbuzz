# FizzBuzz
Fizzbuzz is the time honored example program in which you need to write a program that returns "Fizz" for numbers divided by 3, "Buzz" for numbers divided by 5, and "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both.  If a number is not divisible by either just return the number.  Now go JavaScript!

To run the specs follow these commands:

```shell
$ learn  # runs only in the terminal
$ learn -b # runs also in the browser
```
